1. Push repo and run unittests in Jenkins
2. If changes where made to the db-schema, ssh to the server (fab -c ../conf/production.conf connect) and make changes in production
3. fab -c ../conf/production.conf build_upload
4. fab -c ../conf/production.conf restart_service
5. Make a call to calculate_premium to see if service is functioning properly
